# Overview

## 1. Problem Statement

Consultants receive significant amounts of source materials - like meeting transcripts, decks, PDFs - and must sit through all just to extract out the useful sections. This process takes a long time and most of the information isn't even relevant to what's needed in the moment. The goal is to build something that ingests the raw model and turns it into a clean, shareable HTML page. An artefact that's quick to skim — so people don't have to read a whole transcript to understand key happenings.

## 2. Requirements & Scope

Take in transcripts, PPTs, PDFs as source input
- Auto-detect whether the content fits a specific format — meeting notes, case study, infographics, narrative — but let the user override if they want different variations
- Flag if source material has internal TCS contents that shouldn't be pasted into a general chat tool
